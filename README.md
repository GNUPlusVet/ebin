# ebin
Made with my friend [dev](http://github.com/ungentoo)<br>
(its our first python script no bullies)<br>

It's called ebin because the original program displayed "ebin" over and over again<br>
I have only tested this on GNU+Linux, not sure if it works on Windows of MacOS/OSX, but it should.<br><br>
Use pip install termcolor to run this.<br><br>
